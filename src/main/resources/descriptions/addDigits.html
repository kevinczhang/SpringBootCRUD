    <p></p><p>
    Given a non-negative integer <code>num</code>, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
</p>

    <p>
        For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Given <code>num = 38</code>, the process is like: <code>3 + 8 = 11</code>, <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>. Since <code>2</code> has only one digit, return it.
    </p>

    <p><b>Follow up:</b><br>
        Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
    </p>
