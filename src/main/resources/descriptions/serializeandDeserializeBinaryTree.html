        <p></p><p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. </p>

<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>

<p>
For example, you may serialize the following tree
</p><pre>    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
</pre>
as <code>"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"</code>, just the same as <a href="https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree">how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree</a>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
