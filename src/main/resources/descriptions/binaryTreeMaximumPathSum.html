    Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
</p>

    <p>For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain <b>at least one node</b> and does not need to go through the root.</p>

    <p>
        For example:<br>
        Given the below binary tree,
    </p><pre>       1
      / \
     2   3
</pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Return <code>6</code>.
    </p><p></p>
