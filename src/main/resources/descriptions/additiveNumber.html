        <p></p><p>Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.</p>

<p>A valid additive sequence should contain <b>at least</b> three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.</p>

<p>
For example:<br>
<code>"112358"</code> is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: <code>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8</code>.
</p><pre>1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8</pre>
<code>"199100199"</code> is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: <code>1, 99, 100, 199</code>.
<pre>1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Numbers in the additive sequence <b>cannot</b> have leading zeros, so sequence <code>1, 2, 03</code> or <code>1, 02, 3</code> is invalid.
</p>

<p>Given a string containing only digits <code>'0'-'9'</code>, write a function to determine if it's an additive number.</p>
