    <p>A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).</p>
    <p>Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.</p>
    <p>For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.</p>
