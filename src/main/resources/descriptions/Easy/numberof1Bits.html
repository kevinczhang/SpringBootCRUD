    <p></p><p>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming weight</a>).</p>

    <p>For example, the 32-bit integer '11' has binary representation <code>00000000000000000000000000001011</code>, so the function should return 3.</p>
