<div class="question-content">
    <p></p><p>Say you have an array for which the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day <i>i</i>.</p>

    <p>If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.</p>

    <p><b>Example 1:</b><br>
    </p><pre>Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
</pre>
    <p></p>

    <p><b>Example 2:</b><br>
    </p><pre>Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
</pre>
