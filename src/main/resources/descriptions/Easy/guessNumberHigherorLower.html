        <p></p><p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p><p> 

</p><p>I pick a number from <b>1</b> to <b><i>n</i></b>. You have to guess which number I picked.</p>

<p>Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.</p>

<p>You call a pre-defined API <code>guess(int num)</code> which returns 3 possible results (<code>-1</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>0</code>):</p>
<pre>-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b><br>
</p><pre>n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.
</pre>
<p></p><p></p>
