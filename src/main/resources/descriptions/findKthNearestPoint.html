    <h1>Nearest Kth</h1>
    <p>Use quickSelect to find the kth nearest point to the origin point
        <br>
        'Time complexity: average O(n), worst O(n^2) when always pick the most
        right one -- the time complexity of quick select'</p>
    <p>Use max Heap
        maintain a max heap with size K,
        every time meet a new point, check if its distance is
        smaller than the heap.peek()
        if yes, pop out the peek, push this point into heap
        in the end we will have K points which are the nearest points
        <br>
        'Time complexity: O(nlgk), space complexity:O(k)'</p>
