<p>A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).</p>

<p>Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<p>Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>Because the range might be a large number, the low and high numbers are represented as string.</p>
