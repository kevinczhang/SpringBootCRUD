            Write a program to find the <code>n</code>-th ugly number.
      </p>

      <p>
            Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include <code>2, 3, 5</code>. For example, <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12</code>            is the sequence of the first <code>10</code> ugly numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
            Note that <code>1</code> is typically treated as an ugly number, and <i>n</i> <b>does not exceed 1690</b>.
