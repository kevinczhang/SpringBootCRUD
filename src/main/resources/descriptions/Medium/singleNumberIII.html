                Given an array of numbers <code>nums</code>, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other
                elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
        </p>
        <p>
                For example:
        </p>
        <p>
                Given <code>nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]</code>, return <code>[3, 5]</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
                <b>Note</b>:<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, <code>[5, 3]</code> is also correct.</li>
                <li>Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space
                        complexity?</li>
        </ol>
