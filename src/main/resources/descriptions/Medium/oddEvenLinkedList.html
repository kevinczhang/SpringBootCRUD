<div class="question-description">
        <p></p><p>Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.</p>

<p>You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Given <code>1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;NULL</code>,<br>
return <code>1-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>
The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input. <br>
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
