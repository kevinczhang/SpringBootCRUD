    <p></p><p>Given a binary search tree, write a function <code>kthSmallest</code> to find the <b>k</b>th smallest element in it.</p>

    <p><b>Note: </b><br>
        You may assume k is always valid, 1 ? k ? BST's total elements.</p>

    <p><b>Follow up:</b><br>
        What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?</p>
