The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     <font color="red">3   1</font>
</pre>
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = <font color="red">3</font> + <font color="red">3</font> + <font color="red">1</font> = <b>7</b>.
