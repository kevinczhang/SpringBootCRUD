    <p><i>Follow up</i> for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":<br>
        What if <i>duplicates</i> are allowed?</p>

    <p>Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?</p>

    <p>Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.</p>

    <p>(i.e., <code>0 1 2 4 5 6 7</code> might become <code>4 5 6 7 0 1 2</code>).</p>

    <p>Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.</p>

    <p>The array may contain duplicates.</p><p></p>
