Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
</p>
<p>
For example,<br>
Given <code>[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]</code>,<br>
The longest increasing subsequence is <code>[2, 3, 7, 101]</code>, therefore the length is <code>4</code>. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
</p>
<p>
Your algorithm should run in O(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>) complexity.
</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b> Could you improve it to O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time complexity? </p>
