        Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include <code>2, 3, 5</code>. For example, <code>6, 8</code>        are ugly while <code>14</code> is not ugly since it includes another prime factor <code>7</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that <code>1</code> is typically treated as an ugly number.
