<div class="question-description">
    <p></p><p>Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, the following two linked lists: </p>
    <pre>A:          a1 -> a2
                   \
                     c1 -> c2 -> c3
                   /
B:     b1 -> b2 -> b3
</pre>
    <p>begin to intersect at node c1.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Notes:</b>
    </p><ul>
    <li>If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return <code>null</code>.</li>
    <li>The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. </li>
    <li>You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.</li>
    <li>Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.</li>
</ul>
